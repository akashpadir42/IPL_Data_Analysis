# IPL_Data_Analysis
In this project, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the IPL Match Dataset spanning from 2008 to 2023, which is available at the following Kaggle link: https://shorturl.at/clG09. The dataset comprises a comprehensive collection of IPL match data covering over a decade. Through EDA, my objective was to gain insights into various aspects of IPL matches, such as team performance, venue statistics, match outcomes, and more. By analyzing the dataset's structure, variables, and distributions, I aimed to uncover patterns, trends, and interesting relationships within the data. This analysis will enhance my understanding of the IPL and contribute to making informed decisions in future IPL-related endeavors.
